        Hello Friends. it nice to be part of this lovely course. I am trying to
        get a front end certificate and web designer is among courses I had to
        take. I love spending time with my family, and most especially, I love
        visiting my quorum memebers, and this always brings me joy and
        happiness.

        I have been into programming for some while now, but I really don't
        practice, I feel I can just learn it and remember it. But now i have
        realize how constant practice is really important in coding. How I wish
        I had been serious all this while, I would have been a good programmer
        by now. I am happy it is not to late and I trying all my best to give my
        best into it.

        I am so happy for my membership in the church of Jesus Christ of Latter
        day Saints. I know the church is true because without the restored
        gospel in my life I would have been nothing.
